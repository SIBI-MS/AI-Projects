# Machine Learning Projects Collection 🤖

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! Each project in this repository is developed using Google Colab and aims to explore different aspects of machine learning and predictive modeling.

## Project List 📋

### RockVSMinePrediction 🪨🆚🚢
In this project, I build a machine learning model to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. This binary classification task uses various features extracted from sonar signals to differentiate between rocks and mines, contributing to underwater object detection.

### WineQualityPrediction 🍷
Explore the world of wine quality with this project, where I develop a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. Using a dataset containing features such as acidity, pH levels, and alcohol content, I train a model to classify wines into different quality categories.

### HeartDiseasePrediction ❤️
In this project, I delve into the realm of healthcare by developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Utilizing a dataset containing various medical attributes such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age, I aim to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart disease.

## Getting Started 🚀
To explore these projects:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the specific project folder of interest.
3. Open the project notebook (.ipynb file) in Google Colab or any other Jupyter Notebook-compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions and run the code cells to explore the project, analyze the data, and train machine learning models.
