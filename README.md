# Machine Learning Projects Collection 🤖

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! Each project in this repository is developed using Google Colab and aims to explore different aspects of machine learning and predictive modeling.

## Project List 📋

### 1. RockVSMinePrediction 🪨🆚🚢
In this project, I build a machine learning model to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. This binary classification task uses various features extracted from sonar signals to differentiate between rocks and mines, contributing to underwater object detection.

### 2. WineQualityPrediction 🍷
Explore the world of wine quality with this project, where I develop a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. Using a dataset containing features such as acidity, pH levels, and alcohol content, I train a model to classify wines into different quality categories.

### 3. HeartDiseasePrediction ❤️
In this project, I delve into the realm of healthcare by developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Utilizing a dataset containing various medical attributes such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age, I aim to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart disease.

### 4. SpamMailDetection 📧
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of email content such as text, sender information, and subject lines, I develop a model capable of accurately identifying spam emails. In this binary classification task, spam emails are labeled as 0, while non-spam (ham) emails are labeled as 1. This model helps users filter out unwanted messages from their inbox effectively, enhancing email security and productivity.
