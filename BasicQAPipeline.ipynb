Martin, and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''. He is the second son of Steffon Baratheon, the lord of Storm's End, and his wife Lady Cassana Estermont, and brother to King Robert and Renly. He is the Lord of Dragonstone and a claimant to the Iron Throne after his elder brother's death. Stannis's goals are frequently impeded by his lack of manpower and resources, owing to his unpopularity with other noble houses. He must therefore rely on the counsel of the foreign priestess Melisandre and his right-hand man, lowborn smuggler Davos Seaworth, who later becomes his Hand of the King. Stannis often struggles to escape the shadow of his two more overtly charismatic brothers, particularly Robert.\\n\\nThough first mentioned in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Stannis formally appeared in ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000) and ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).  In December 2011, Martin posted a sample chapter from the yet-unfinished ''The Winds of Winter'', told from Theon Greyjoy's viewpoint, which confirmed Stannis' return in the sixth book.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '6d51432d5a55c90a7bb92fdb5215be75'}>,\n",

The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying \"The boys I recorded completely separate.

The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, \"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.\"In early seasons, under the influence of the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers.

R. Martin conceived The Red Wedding during the earliest stages of the planning of his saga, when he was envisioning a trilogy with The Red Wedding as one of the climactic events at the end of the first of the three books.

One of them was the 15th century historical event known as the \"Black Dinner\", where the Scottish king invited the chieftains of the powerful Clan Douglas to a feast at Edinburgh Castle. A black bull\\'s head, the symbol of death, was served as the last course of the dinner while a single drum was playing in the background, and the Douglases were murdered.

He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only when the rest of the book was finished, he \"forced himself\" to come back to the dreaded scene. In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that \"he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air\".\\n\\nMartin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark\\'s heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing.

He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.

Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than ''A Storm of Swords'', Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to ''A Clash of Kings''. A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.\\n\\nIn 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002.

Primarily referred to as \\'\\'\\'the Others\\'\\'\\' in the novels, White Walkers are a supernatural threat to humankind who dwell north of The Wall in Westeros. \\'\\'The Verge\\'\\' named them among \"the most visually iconic creatures on the show\". White Walkers are also featured in the show\\'s merchandising.\\n\\n==Description==\\nMartin introduces the Others in the prologue of \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\' (1996), describing them as \"Tall ... and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk\" with eyes \"deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like ice\". Accompanied by intense cold, they wear armor that \"seemed to change color as it moved\", and wield thin crystal swords capable of shattering steel. The Others move silently, and they speak their own language; Martin writes that their voices are \"like the cracking of ice on a winter lake\".

This was weakened by the emergence of the Others, an enigmatic and malevolent nonhuman species who inflicted a night that lasted a generation and a winter that lasted decades. After the Others were pushed back, the Children and the First Men raised The Wall, a vast barrier of stone, ice and magic from one coast of northern Westeros to the other, to bar the passage of the Others south.\\n\\n===\\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\'===\\nAs \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\' (1996) begins, the general belief across Westeros is that the Others are a legend to scare children, or else \"gone eight thousand years\".

However, after a few meetings, Djawadi was persuaded to take on the project. The showrunners Benioff and Weiss sent Djawadi the first two episodes of the series, which impressed Djawadi. He arranged a meeting with Benioff and Weiss to discuss the concept of the series, after which he began to compose the music for the series.\\n\\nAccording to Djawadi, Benioff and Weiss were interested in using music to support the different characters and plots.
